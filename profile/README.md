## Welcome to Zigzag ðŸ‘‹

Zigzag is an opiniated set of tools in typescript and react for the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. It's built on top on the official @polkadot-js repos with a goal to provide simple, easy to use tools for developers. Our goal is to make sure your can focus on building âœ¨ awesome web3 âœ¨ apps with Polkadot while we take care of everything else.

### Libraries

#### @zigzag/chains
A quick way to get details for all the chains in the Dotsama ecosystem. `@zigzag/chains` provides you everything you need from a parachain or a relaychain. 

#### @zigzag/modal (coming soon)
An authentication modal for react similar to web3modal for the Dotsama ecosystem. This library will provide you with a set of ContextProviders and Buttons that'll make authenticating with Polkadot a matter of minutes.
More details coming soon... (TBD)

#### @zigzag/hooks (coming soon)
A non-exhaustive set of hooks on top of the @polkadot/api. You can use this alongside @zigzag/modal. More details coming soon...

### Documentation

We are still very much in early development so there isn't an official docs website. You will find some docs in the repo's README.md for now.
